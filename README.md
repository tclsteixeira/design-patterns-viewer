From a list of software design patterns you can view the description of the pattern, a code example, its frequency of use, the participant entities and real world usage cases examples in a single window.
Patterns data are stored in a sqlite3 database.
The project can be built with Eclipse 2023 CDT, including pkg-config in the build command with gtk3, gtksourceview3 and sqlite3 libraries. Eclipse project and settings files are included for a faster start up. 
You will need the gtk3 and gtksourceview development libraries installed in your system and sqlite3.
